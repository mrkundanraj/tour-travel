    <h2> Partition Museum In Amritsar:</h2>
    <p>The Partition Museum in Amritsar, India, is the world's first museum dedicated to the period of <br>
        the Partition of India and Pakistan. The museum is divided into 14 galleries, each spotlighting <br>
        different chronological themes. The galleries focus on topics such as the anti-colonial movement,<br>
         the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the Komagata Maru incident, the All India Muslim League and the <br>
         Indian National Congress, and the journey of resilience and recuperation for women. </p>

    <p>Through the first gallery, visitors are invited to explore the narrative of local communities as <br>
        well as a broader national chronicle. It features several items that evoke the history of the area, <br>
        such as a picture of the clock tower built by the British and later demolished, a picture of the 1947 <br>
        Hall Bazaar shopping street, a map of the area from 1888, and handmade phulkari and bagh prints. <br>
        The second gallery includes a 100-year-old brass Hamam (geyser), a 1931 map, and a certificate from<br>
         the British Raj. Together, these galleries provide an insight into the history of the region.</p>
         <p>The third and fourth galleries explore the anti-colonial movement in India from 1900- 1931.<br>
             Highlights of the exhibit include the original "Simon go back" board, the Young India weekly <br>
             journal by Mahatma Gandhi, and a photo of the Jallianwala Bagh before the massacre. Additionally,<br>
              a voiceover of the 1905 protest anthem of Bangladesh, "O amar sonar Bangla, ami tomai bhalobashi",<br>
               plays in the background to emphasize the resistance to the British and the Roulette Movement.</p>
               <p>Other galleries in this museum take visitors through the political and geographical turbulence<br>
                 of British India's final days. It features installations such as bullet-riddled walls and displays<br>
                  of Sir Cyril Radcliffe&rsquos feats and service in World War II. Gallery Seven contains an exhibit <br>
                  about resilience and recuperation for women. Galleries Nine and Ten communicate tragic stories about <br>
                  the Partition of India with a tribute to the women who died rather than face gendered violence. Eleven<br>
                   through thirteen galleries exhibit stories of displaced people and their possessions.</p>


                   <h2>About partiton mesume</h2>
                   <p>Perhaps there are no coincidences in life, because this year, when the world’s first Partition <br>
                    Museum will be completed in Amritsar, the theme for the International Museums Day was “museums and<br>
                     contested histories: saying the unspeakable in museums”.</p>
                     <p>A far-fetched idea perhaps in India , where thus far, museums have usually been very safe zones — <br>
                        meditating upon a vast heritage of art and culture. These repositories have reflected pride and endeavour<br>
                         — but rarely failure or defeat. They have looked at cultural triumphs 5000 years ago, and forgotten the<br>
                          events of just 70 years ago. Museums have been more about collections than experience. About documentation<br>
                           rather than memory . About history through objects, rather than story telling. And usually the collections,<br>
                            if donated, are from the wealthy, not from the marginalised.</p>
