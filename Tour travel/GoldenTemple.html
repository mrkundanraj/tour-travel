    <h2>History of Golden Temple</h2>
    <p>The beautiful holy temple Sri Harmandir Sahib, popularly referred to as the “Golden Temple,”<br>
         is situated in Amritsar, Punjab, India. There is also the holiest shrine in Sikhism, and as a <br>
         result, many Sikhs visit it every day. Along with being a well-liked tourist site, it is an important<br>
          Sikh destination. The “Golden Temple” and the Sikh religion were developed at a time when the caste</p>
          <p>According to the Sikh historical records, the land that became Amritsar and houses the <br>
            Harimandir Sahib was chosen by Guru Amar Das, the third Guru of the Sikh tradition. It was<br>
             then called Guru Da Chakk, after he had asked his disciple Ram Das to find land to start a <br>
             new town with a man-made pool as its central point.[6][7][22] After Guru Ram Das succeeded Guru<br>
              Amar Das in 1574, and in the face of hostile opposition from the sons of Guru Amar Das,[23] Guru<br>
               Ram Das founded the town that came to be known as "Ramdaspur". He started by completing the pool<br>
                with the help of Baba Buddha (not to be confused with the Buddha of Buddhism). Guru Ram Das built<br>
                 his new official centre and home next to it. He invited merchants and artisans from other parts of<br>
                  India to settle in the new town with him.[22]</p>

                  <h2>Construction</h2>
                  <p>Guru Ram Das acquired the land for the site. Two versions of stories exist on how he acquired this land.<br>
                     In one, based on a Gazetteer record, the land was purchased with Sikh donations of 700 rupees from the people<br>
                      and owners of the village of Tung. In another version, Emperor Akbar is stated to have donated the land to <br>
                      the wife of Guru Ram Das.[22][28]<br>


                    The Golden Temple, Amritsar, c. 1840
                    In 1581, Guru Arjan initiated the <br>construction of the Gurdwara.[1] During the construction the pool <br>
                     kept empty and dry. It took 8 years to complete the first version of the Harmandir Sahib. Guru Arjan<br>
                      planned a gurdwara at a level lower than the city to emphasise humility and the need to efface one's<br>
                       ego before entering the premises to meet the Guru.[1] He also demanded that the gurdwara compound be<br>
                        open on all sides to emphasise that it was open to all. The sanctum inside the pool where his Guru seat<br>
                         was, had only one bridge to emphasise that the end goal was one, states Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair.[1] In <br>
                         1589, the gurdwara made with bricks was complete. Guru Arjan is believed by some later sources to have <br>
                         invited the Sufi saint Mian Mir of Lahore to lay its foundation stone, signalling pluralism and that the<br>
                          Sikh tradition welcomed all.[1] This belief is however unsubstantiated.[29][30] According to Sikh traditional<br>
                           sources such as Sri Gur Suraj Parkash Granth it was laid by Guru Arjan himself.[31] After the inauguration,<br>
                            the pool was filled with water. On 16 August 1604, Guru Arjan completed expanding and compiling the first<br>
                             version of the Sikh scripture and placed a copy of the Adi Granth in the gurdwara. He appointed Baba Buddha <br>
                             as the first Granthi.[32]</p>
                             <h2>The Golden Temple today:</h2>
                             <p>The temple welcomes over 100,000 visitors a day, many of them devotees. It’s often heaving, unsurprisingly, <br>so don’t expect to get more than a few minutes in the sanctum itself.<br> Nonetheless, it’s impressive – the sheer amount of gold, the blend of Hindu <br>and Islamic architecture, the detailed flower and animal motifs and the<br> never-ending chant from the Guru Grant Sahib add to the atmosphere of awe.<br>

                                The whole compound takes several hours to explore: look out for the Sikh Museum near the entrance for further<br> context on the role of Sikhs in India and Operation Blue Star, and for<br>
                                
                                Ramgarhia Bunga, a protective fortress with a slab of stone inside previously used for Mughal coronations which <br>Sikh forces stole from Delhi.</p>
                                <h2>Religious practices:</h2>
                                <p>The Golden Temple is open to anyone regardless of caste, religion, or race, provided that pilgrims cover their <br>heads, remove shoes, and wash feet and hands before entering, as is the norm at gurdwaras.<br> The most important ritual practice at the Golden Temple is the daily continuous gurbani (sayings of the Gurus)<br> kirtan (singing). This singing begins early in the morning with the opening of the doors<br> of the Akal Takht, where the sacred book, the Adi Granth (also reverently called<br> the Guru Granth Sahib since the book is regarded as a living Guru), rests each night.<br> After the doors open in the early hours of the morning and singing begins, the Adi Granth is brought<br> to the central main room, or sanctum sanctorum, of the Golden Temple. Devotees sing gurbani kirtan <br>throughout the day until late in the night when the Adi Granth is returned to the Akal Takht.<br>

                                    Pilgrims to the Golden Temple complex bathe in the pool and circumambulate the central temple. Of particular<br> 
                                    
                                    importance for visitors to the Golden Temple is the langar, a free kitchen that feeds a <br>vegetarian meal to approximately 100,000
                                     people each day. In the langar, all visitors sit on the floor and eat together<br> as a community without demarcations of religion,
                                      race, or caste.</p>
