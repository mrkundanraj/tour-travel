    <h2>Jallianwala Bagh</h2>
        <p>Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, incident on April 13, 1919, in which British troops fired on a large crowd of unarmed <br>
            Indians in an open space known as the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar in the Punjab region (now in Punjab state) of <br>
            India, killing several hundred people and wounding many hundreds more. It marked a turning point in India’s modern<br>
             history, in that it left a permanent scar on Indo-British relations and was the prelude to Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi’s<br>
              full commitment to the cause of Indian nationalism and independence from Britain.<br>
              

        

            During World War I (1914–18) the British government of India enacted a series of repressive emergency powers that were<br>
             intended to combat subversive activities. By the war’s end, expectations were high among the Indian populace that those<br>
              measures would be eased and that India would be given more political autonomy. The Montagu-Chelmsford Report, presented <br>
              to the British Parliament in 1918, did in fact recommend limited local self-government. Instead, however, the government of<br>
               India passed what became known as the Rowlatt Acts in early 1919, which essentially extended the repressive wartime measures.</p>>

               <h2>About Jallianwala Bagh Massacre:</h2>
               <p>On 13 April 1919, people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh (Amritsar) to protest against the arrest of the two nationalist leaders,<br>
                 Satya Pal and Dr Saifuddin Kitchlew. Suddenly, a British military officer, General Dyer, entered the park with his troops. Without <br>
                 even giving a warning to the people to disperse, he ordered his troops to fire at the unarmed crowd for ten minutes and when their <br>
                 ammunition was exhausted, they left. In those ten minutes, according to the estimates of the congress, about a thousand persons were<br>
                  killed and about 2000 wounded. The bullet marks can be still seen on the walls of the Jallianwala Bagh which is now a national memorial.</p>
               <h2>What is the story of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre?:</h2>
               <p>The situation in Punjab was alarming as there were riots and protests against the Rowlatt Act.
                Punjab was put under martial law, which meant that it became unlawful for more than 4 people to assemble at a place.
                The Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab at that time was Michael O’Dwyer. Lord Chelmsford was India’s Viceroy.
                On the day of the festival of Baisakhi on 13th April 1919 in Jallianwala Bagh, a public garden in Amritsar, 
                General Dyer came there with his troops and blocked the only narrow entrance to the garden.
                Then, without warning, he ordered his troops to fire at the unarmed crowd, which included children as well.
                The indiscriminate firing went on for about 10 minutes until the 1650 rounds of ammunition were exhausted. 
                This tragedy came as a rude shock to Indians and totally destroyed their faith in the British system of justice.
                National leaders condemned the act and Dyer unequivocally.
                However, Dyer was appreciated by many in Britain and the British in India, although some people in the British govern
                The government set up the Hunter Commission to inquire into the massacre. Although the commission condemned the act b
                He was relieved of his duties in the army in 1920.
                In protest against the massacre and the British failure to give due justice to the victims, Rabindran
                Michael O’Dwyer, the then Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, who had approved the actions of Brigadier-General Dyer, was  </pre>
